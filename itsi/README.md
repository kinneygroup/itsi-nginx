### Services
Nginx monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of server performance and security:

1. Nginx Deployment
    * Description: This represents the overall deployment of Nginx, encompassing all aspects of its operation and performance.
2. Web Traffic Management
    * Description: This service focuses on monitoring and managing the traffic handled by Nginx, including request rates and response times.
3. Request Handling
    * Description: This service monitors the rate and efficiency of request processing by Nginx.
4. Connection Management
    * Description: This service monitors the connections to the Nginx server, including active, idle, and dropped connections.
5. Server Health
    * Description: This service monitors the overall health of the servers running Nginx, including CPU, memory, and disk usage.
6. Process Health
    * Description: This service monitors the health of Nginx processes, including master and worker processes.
7. Security Monitoring
    * Description: This service focuses on monitoring the security aspects of the Nginx deployment, including SSL certificate expiration and HTTP response codes.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Nginx Deployment
    * Description: This represents the overall deployment of Nginx, encompassing all aspects of its operation and performance.
    * Source: N/A (General knowledge)
2. Requests per Second
    * Description: Monitor the rate at which Nginx is handling requests.
3. Server Error Rate
    * Description: Track the number of 5xx errors divided by the total number of status codes.
4. Response Time
    * Description: Measure how quickly requests are being handled.
5. Request Processing Time
    * Description: Measure the time taken to process client requests.
6. Total Requests
    * Description: Monitor the total number of requests handled by Nginx.
7. Reading Request Headers
    * Description: Monitor the number of requests currently being read.
8. Active Connections
    * Description: Current number of active connections.
9. Dropped Connections
    * Description: Number of connections dropped due to resource limits.
10. Connection Limits
    * Description: Monitor the total number of connections Nginx can handle.
11. CPU Usage
    * Description: Monitor the CPU usage of the server.
12. Memory Usage
    * Description: Monitor the memory usage of the server.
13. Disk Space Usage
    * Description: Monitor the disk space usage to prevent system failures due to full disks.
14. Nginx Processes
    * Description: Monitor the health of Nginx processes (master, worker, and caching processes).
15. Load Average
    * Description: Summarize CPU and disk usage with 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute running load averages.
16. SSL Certificate Expiration
    * Description: Monitor SSL certificate expiration to avoid security issues and site unavailability.
17. HTTP Response Codes
    * Description: Analyze HTTP response codes logged by Nginx to identify potential issues.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, Nginx Deployment is dependent on Web Traffic Management, Server Health, and Security Monitoring. Similarly, Web Traffic Management relies on Request Handling and Connection Management to ensure efficient traffic flow.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Server Health depending on Resource Monitoring and Process Health, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
